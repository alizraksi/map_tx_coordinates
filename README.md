# Bioinformatics Exercise #

The goal of this software that translates transcript coordinates to genomic coordinates.

The questions are addressed in the docstrings within the code (strengths and weaknesses, how the code was tested, etc.).

## Usage ##
The usage for the code is as follows, where the parameters are the file paths (TRANSCRIPTS is input file 1 and QUERIES is input file 2):

```
python map_tx_coordinates.py --transcripts TRANSCRIPTS --queries QUERIES --output OUTPUT
```
